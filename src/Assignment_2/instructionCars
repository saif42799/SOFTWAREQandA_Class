Cars

You are to write some basic classes in Java. You are to implement Vehicle.java, Car.java, Truck.java and MainTest.java classes. Each Vehicle object will represent information about a specific automobile that is for sale. Essential data should include:

    Make and model
    Model year
    Is it 4 wheel drive or not?
    Retail Price
    Miles Per Gallon

A Car has an additional property:

    Is it convertible?

A Truck has some special properties:

    Has Side Step?
    Tow Capacity

You must implement the complete classes, including data members and methods. You must use inheritance and you must implement:

    Constructors
    Getters and Setters
    printVehicle() â†’ To print out any vehicle object. Example output:

2015 Ford F-150
4WD
$35,000
17MPG
No Side Step
Tow up to 2 tons

In a test method in file MainTest.java, test your program by doing the following:

    Create an array (or a list) of Vehicle so you can hold objects of Car and Truck.
    Create a few objects of Car and Truck, set their values, and save them to the array (or list).
    Loop through the array (or list) and output the vehicles.

Submit the files Vehicle.java, Car.java, Truck.java and MainTest.java when done.
